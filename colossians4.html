<p><strong>1</strong> Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>

<h4><b> Further Instructions</b></h4>

<p><strong>2</strong> Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong>  And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. </p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong> Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. </p>


<h4><b> Final Greetings</b></h4>

<p><strong>7</strong>Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant[a] in the Lord. </p>
<p><strong>8</strong> I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our[b] circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. </p>
<p><strong>10</strong>   My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) </p>
<p><strong>11</strong>   Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews[c] among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong>  Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong> I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong>  Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. </p>
<p><strong>15</strong>  Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong>  After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea. </p>
<p><strong>17</strong> Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”</p>
<p><strong>18</strong>  I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. </p>
